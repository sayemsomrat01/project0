The foundations of networking: <b>switches, routers, and wireless access points

Switches, routers, and wireless access points</b> are the essential networking basics. Through them, devices connected 
to your network can communicate with one another and with other networks, like the Internet. Switches, routers, and
 wireless access points perform very different functions in a network.
 <br> <br>
 <u><b>Switches :</b></u><br>
 Switches are the foundation of most business networks. A switch acts as a controller, connecting computers, printers,
 and servers to a network in a building or a campus. <br>

 Switches allow devices on your network to communicate with each other, as well as with other networks, creating a network
 of shared resources. Through information sharing and resource allocation, switches save money and increase productivity.
 
 <br>

 There are two basic types of switches to choose from as part of your networking basics: on-premises and cloud-managed.
 
 A managed on-premises switch lets you configure and monitor your LAN, giving you tighter control of your network traffic.
 <br>
 Have a small IT team? A cloud-managed switch can simplify your network management. You get a simple user interface, multisite
full-stack management, and automatic updates delivered directly to the switch.
<br>
<u><b>Routers:</b></u> <br>
Routers connect multiple networks together. They also connect computers on those networks to the Internet. Routers enable all
networked computers to share a single Internet connection, which saves money. <br>
A router acts a dispatcher. It analyzes data being sent across a network, chooses the best route for data to travel, and sends 
it on its way. <br>
Routers connect your business to the world, protect information from security threats, and can even decide which computers 
receive priority over others. <br>
Beyond those basic networking functions, routers come with additional features to make networking easier or more secure. 
Depending on your security needs, for example, you can choose a router with a firewall, a virtual private network (VPN), or an Internet Protocol (IP) communications system.
