             <b>What is data transmission?</b> <br>
             Data transmission refers to the process of transferring data between two or more digital devices. Data is transmitted from one
             device to another in analog or digital format. Basically, data transmission enables devices or components within devices to speak to each other.
             <br>
             <b>How does data transmission work between digital devices?</b><br>
             Data is transferred in the form of bits between two or more digital devices. There are two methods used to transmit data between digital devices: serial
             transmission and parallel transmission. Serial data transmission sends data bits one after another over a single channel. Parallel data transmission sends
             multiple data bits at the same time over multiple channels.
             <br>
             <b>What is serial transmission?</b><br>
                When data is sent or received using serial data transmission, the data bits are organized in a specific order, since they can only be sent one after 
                another. The order of the data bits is important as it dictates how the transmission is organized when it is received. It is viewed as a reliable data 
                transmission method because a data bit is only sent if the previous data bit has already been received.
                <br>       
               <b>What is parallel transmission?</b><br>
                When data is sent using parallel data transmission, multiple data bits are transmitted over multiple channels at the same time. This means that data can
                be sent much faster than using serial transmission methods.Given that multiple bits are sent over multiple channels at the same time, the order in which
                a bit string is received can depend on various conditions, such as proximity to the data source, user location, and bandwidth availability.
